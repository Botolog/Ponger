##  Getting Started

###  Installation

take the apk from the releases and install on your phone

###  Usage
Use `Offline` to enter offline session. to create new lobby enter its ID and press `New`. To join existing lobby type its ID and press `Join`.
Simple as that.

In the lobby press the bottom left bottom button to switch player perspective, default is player (that means that you are starting with serve).
Use the `Delete` button to remove 1 point from the player.

The light blue color indicates who is serving this round(!). this is the differnce between player1 and player2. 
if your opponent is starting with the serve on his phone the button should say "Player1" and on your Phone the button should say "Player2".

If one of the players' color is green, that means he won!
